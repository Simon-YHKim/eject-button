# checkpoint — Detailed Reference

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Operational Self-Improvement

Before completing, reflect on this session:
- Did any commands fail unexpectedly?
- Did you take a wrong approach and have to backtrack?
- Did you discover a project-specific quirk (build order, env vars, timing, auth)?
- Did something take longer than expected because of a missing flag or config?

If yes, log an operational learning for future sessions:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"observed"}'
```

Replace SKILL_NAME with the current skill name. Only log genuine operational discoveries.
Don't log obvious things or one-time transient errors (network blips, rate limits).
A good test: would knowing this save 5+ minutes in a future session? If yes, log it.

## Telemetry (run last)

After the skill workflow completes (success, error, or abort), log the telemetry event.
Determine the skill name from the `name:` field in this file's YAML frontmatter.
Determine the outcome from the workflow result (success if completed normally, error
if it failed, abort if the user interrupted).

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.gstack/analytics/` (user config directory, not project files). The skill
preamble already writes to the same directory — this is the same pattern.
Skipping this command loses session duration and outcome data.

Run this bash:

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
rm -f ~/.gstack/analytics/.pending-"$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
# Session timeline: record skill completion (local-only, never sent anywhere)
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-timeline-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","event":"completed","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)'","outcome":"OUTCOME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
# Local analytics (gated on telemetry setting)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ]; then
echo '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","browse":"USED_BROWSE","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
fi
# Remote telemetry (opt-in, requires binary)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ] && [ -x ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log \
    --skill "SKILL_NAME" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
    --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null &
fi
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME` with the actual skill name from frontmatter, `OUTCOME` with
success/error/abort, and `USED_BROWSE` with true/false based on whether `$B` was used.
If you cannot determine the outcome, use "unknown". The local JSONL always logs. The
remote binary only runs if telemetry is not off and the binary exists.

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

When in plan mode, these operations are always allowed because they produce
artifacts that inform the plan, not code changes:

- `$B` commands (browse: screenshots, page inspection, navigation, snapshots)
- `$D` commands (design: generate mockups, variants, comparison boards, iterate)
- `codex exec` / `codex review` (outside voice, plan review, adversarial challenge)
- Writing to `~/.gstack/` (config, analytics, review logs, design artifacts, learnings)
- Writing to the plan file (already allowed by plan mode)
- `open` commands for viewing generated artifacts (comparison boards, HTML previews)

These are read-only in spirit — they inspect the live site, generate visual artifacts,
or get independent opinions. They do NOT modify project source files.

## Skill Invocation During Plan Mode

If a user invokes a skill during plan mode, that invoked skill workflow takes
precedence over generic plan mode behavior until it finishes or the user explicitly
cancels that skill.

Treat the loaded skill as executable instructions, not reference material. Follow
it step by step. Do not summarize, skip, reorder, or shortcut its steps.

If the skill says to use AskUserQuestion, do that. Those AskUserQuestion calls
satisfy plan mode's requirement to end turns with AskUserQuestion.

If the skill reaches a STOP point, stop immediately at that point, ask the required
question if any, and wait for the user's response. Do not continue the workflow
past a STOP point, and do not call ExitPlanMode at that point.

If the skill includes commands marked "PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN," execute
them. The skill may edit the plan file, and other writes are allowed only if they
are already permitted by Plan Mode Safe Operations or explicitly marked as a plan
mode exception.

Only call ExitPlanMode after the active skill workflow is complete and there are no
other invoked skill workflows left to run, or if the user explicitly tells you to
cancel the skill or leave plan mode.

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-review-read
\`\`\`

Then write a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |
| DX Review | \`/plan-devex-review\` | Developer experience gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

# /checkpoint — Save and Resume Working State

You are a **Staff Engineer who keeps meticulous session notes**. Your job is to
capture the full working context — what's being done, what decisions were made,
what's left — so that any future session (even on a different branch or workspace)
can resume without losing a beat.

**HARD GATE:** Do NOT implement code changes. This skill captures and restores
context only.

---

## Detect command

Parse the user's input to determine which command to run:

- `/checkpoint` or `/checkpoint save` → **Save**
- `/checkpoint resume` → **Resume**
- `/checkpoint list` → **List**

If the user provides a title after the command (e.g., `/checkpoint auth refactor`),
use it as the checkpoint title. Otherwise, infer a title from the current work.

---

## Save flow

### Step 1: Gather state

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" && mkdir -p ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG
```

Collect the current working state:

```bash
echo "=== BRANCH ==="
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null
echo "=== STATUS ==="
git status --short 2>/dev/null
echo "=== DIFF STAT ==="
git diff --stat 2>/dev/null
echo "=== STAGED DIFF STAT ==="
git diff --cached --stat 2>/dev/null
echo "=== RECENT LOG ==="
git log --oneline -10 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: Summarize context

Using the gathered state plus your conversation history, produce a summary covering:

1. **What's being worked on** — the high-level goal or feature
2. **Decisions made** — architectural choices, trade-offs, approaches chosen and why
3. **Remaining work** — concrete next steps, in priority order
4. **Notes** — anything a future session needs to know (gotchas, blocked items,
   open questions, things that were tried and didn't work)

If the user provided a title, use it. Otherwise, infer a concise title (3-6 words)
from the work being done.

### Step 3: Compute session duration

Try to determine how long this session has been active:

```bash
# Try _TEL_START (Conductor timestamp) first, then shell process start time
if [ -n "$_TEL_START" ]; then
  START_EPOCH="$_TEL_START"
elif [ -n "$PPID" ]; then
  START_EPOCH=$(ps -o lstart= -p $PPID 2>/dev/null | xargs -I{} date -jf "%c" "{}" "+%s" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
fi
if [ -n "$START_EPOCH" ]; then
  NOW=$(date +%s)
  DURATION=$((NOW - START_EPOCH))
  echo "SESSION_DURATION_S=$DURATION"
else
  echo "SESSION_DURATION_S=unknown"
fi
```

If the duration cannot be determined, omit the `session_duration_s` field from the
checkpoint file.

### Step 4: Write checkpoint file

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" && mkdir -p ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG
CHECKPOINT_DIR="$HOME/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/checkpoints"
mkdir -p "$CHECKPOINT_DIR"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
echo "CHECKPOINT_DIR=$CHECKPOINT_DIR"
echo "TIMESTAMP=$TIMESTAMP"
```

Write the checkpoint file to `{CHECKPOINT_DIR}/{TIMESTAMP}-{title-slug}.md` where
`title-slug` is the title in kebab-case (lowercase, spaces replaced with hyphens,
special characters removed).

The file format:

```markdown
---
status: in-progress
branch: {current branch name}
timestamp: {ISO-8601 timestamp, e.g. 2026-03-31T14:30:00-07:00}
session_duration_s: {computed duration, omit if unknown}
files_modified:
  - path/to/file1
  - path/to/file2
---

## Working on: {title}

### Summary

{1-3 sentences describing the high-level goal and current progress}

### Decisions Made

{Bulleted list of architectural choices, trade-offs, and reasoning}

### Remaining Work

{Numbered list of concrete next steps, in priority order}

### Notes

{Gotchas, blocked items, open questions, things tried that didn't work}
```

The `files_modified` list comes from `git status --short` (both staged and unstaged
modified files). Use relative paths from the repo root.

After writing, confirm to the user:

```
CHECKPOINT SAVED
════════════════════════════════════════
Title:    {title}
Branch:   {branch}
File:     {path to checkpoint file}
Modified: {N} files
Duration: {duration or "unknown"}
════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

## Resume flow

### Step 1: Find checkpoints

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" && mkdir -p ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG
CHECKPOINT_DIR="$HOME/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/checkpoints"
if [ -d "$CHECKPOINT_DIR" ]; then
  find "$CHECKPOINT_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -1t 2>/dev/null | head -20
else
  echo "NO_CHECKPOINTS"
fi
```

List checkpoints from **all branches** (checkpoint files contain the branch name
in their frontmatter, so all files in the directory are candidates). This enables
Conductor workspace handoff — a checkpoint saved on one branch can be resumed from
another.

### Step 2: Load checkpoint

If the user specified a checkpoint (by number, title fragment, or date), find the
matching file. Otherwise, load the **most recent** checkpoint.

Read the checkpoint file and present a summary:

```
RESUMING CHECKPOINT
════════════════════════════════════════
Title:       {title}
Branch:      {branch from checkpoint}
Saved:       {timestamp, human-readable}
Duration:    Last session was {formatted duration} (if available)
Status:      {status}
════════════════════════════════════════

### Summary
{summary from checkpoint}

### Remaining Work
{remaining work items from checkpoint}

### Notes
{notes from checkpoint}
```

If the current branch differs from the checkpoint's branch, note this:
"This checkpoint was saved on branch `{branch}`. You are currently on
`{current branch}`. You may want to switch branches before continuing."

### Step 3: Offer next steps

After presenting the checkpoint, ask via AskUserQuestion:

- A) Continue working on the remaining items
- B) Show the full checkpoint file
- C) Just needed the context, thanks

If A, summarize the first remaining work item and suggest starting there.

---

## List flow

### Step 1: Gather checkpoints

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" && mkdir -p ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG
CHECKPOINT_DIR="$HOME/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/checkpoints"
if [ -d "$CHECKPOINT_DIR" ]; then
  echo "CHECKPOINT_DIR=$CHECKPOINT_DIR"
  find "$CHECKPOINT_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -1t 2>/dev/null
else
  echo "NO_CHECKPOINTS"
fi
```

### Step 2: Display table

**Default behavior:** Show checkpoints for the **current branch** only.

If the user passes `--all` (e.g., `/checkpoint list --all`), show checkpoints
from **all branches**.

Read the frontmatter of each checkpoint file to extract `status`, `branch`, and
`timestamp`. Parse the title from the filename (the part after the timestamp).

Present as a table:

```
CHECKPOINTS ({branch} branch)
════════════════════════════════════════
#  Date        Title                    Status
─  ──────────  ───────────────────────  ───────────
1  2026-03-31  auth-refactor            in-progress
2  2026-03-30  api-pagination           completed
3  2026-03-28  db-migration-setup       in-progress
════════════════════════════════════════
```

If `--all` is used, add a Branch column:

```
CHECKPOINTS (all branches)
════════════════════════════════════════
#  Date        Title                    Branch              Status
─  ──────────  ───────────────────────  ──────────────────  ───────────
1  2026-03-31  auth-refactor            feat/auth           in-progress
2  2026-03-30  api-pagination           main                completed
3  2026-03-28  db-migration-setup       feat/db-migration   in-progress
════════════════════════════════════════
```

If there are no checkpoints, tell the user: "No checkpoints saved yet. Run
`/checkpoint` to save your current working state."

---

## Important Rules

- **Never modify code.** This skill only reads state and writes checkpoint files.
- **Always include the branch name** in checkpoint files — this is critical for
  cross-branch resume in Conductor workspaces.
- **Checkpoint files are append-only.** Never overwrite or delete existing checkpoint
  files. Each save creates a new file.
- **Infer, don't interrogate.** Use git state and conversation context to fill in
  the checkpoint. Only use AskUserQuestion if the title genuinely cannot be inferred.
